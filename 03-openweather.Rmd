# Historical UV Index

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r include=TRUE}

lat = 56.1572
lon = 10.2107

res = GET(paste0("https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat=",lat,"&lon=",lon,"&appid=94337b7f8e577fff69707a375f192c8d"))

jsonlite::fromJSON( rawToChar( res$content ) )
```
